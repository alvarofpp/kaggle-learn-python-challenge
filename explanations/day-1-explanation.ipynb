Good news: we have [several tracks on Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) for just that purpose. The goal of this challenge is to quickly cover the fundamentals of the language - which will hopefully stand you in good stead whether you use Python for deep learning, data cleaning, or cheating at Scrabble.\n\nEach day of the Python Challenge will consist of two parts:\n- A **tutorial** notebook explaining Python concepts and showing example code. That's where you are now.\n- An [**exercise**](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424) notebook with questions and coding problems to test your new knowledge.\n\nToday's tutorial includes a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, day 1 might not hold anything new for you, so feel free to [skip straight to the exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424).\n\n> These lessons borrow and adapt some content from [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/whirlwind-tour-of-python-index). Thanks to the author, Jake VanderPlas, for releasing it under a permissive license. If you're interested in a more thorough, theoretical grounding in Python, I encourage you to check out WTOP.\n"

Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call it \"executable pseudocode\"). \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new \"code block\" is coming up. Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)"
